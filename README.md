# Dawn Will Come
This repository contains the GB Studio project files for Dawn Will Come, an entry for the GBCompo21 by eishiya, H0lyhandgrenade, and C_DOS_KEZ.
The project was built in GBS 2.0 beta5, and may not work in other versions.

## Engine mods
Dawn Will Come uses several engine mods in addition to scripts created via the IDE:
- rulz's UI Interactable hack, to allow text boxes to not block input, modified for 2.0.0-e18.
- HP Display mod, which allows automatically generating HP containers based on variables. It was written for this game, but was shared with the community early during the jam.
- A third fade option hack, which adds a third "partial" fade option. This is used for the combat scenes in the game, and only works for DMG projects. CGB projects will show the black fade when this option is used.
